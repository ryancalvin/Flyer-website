photos, videos etc.</li><br>
<li>In order a user to have access to the services of social media applications, should create a
specific profile and identity.</li><br>

      <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>Be informed on what your children might see</i></p><br>
	  <p class="w3-justify">
		<h3>Hooked on scrolling</h3>
Instagram revealed that young users spent a minimum of 32 minutes on the app per day. Many social media platforms have been designed in a way to keep us engaged on them for as long as possible. Children and adults may quickly lose track of time and find themselves scrolling for several dozens of minutes or even hours. They usually scroll until they find that ‘something’ they are looking for.
		<h3>Sliding into direct messages</h3>
Direct messages allow users to share posts, images, videos, voice messages and calls between each other. In most applications, even if your children’s account is set to private, anybody has the option to send them a message. In case that the person is not on your children's friends list, the message will still be sent to their inbox but the user has to accept their request to see the message.
		<h3>Influencer culture</h3>
Social media applications have created more or less the so called “influencer culture”. Influencers are sometimes paid thousands of pounds to promote a product, a service, an app and much more on social media. When celebrities or influencers post such an advert, they should add a disclaimer somewhere in the post which states that they have been paid for it. Commonly, this is well-hidden in the hashtags or in the comments of their post, making it unclear that their photo/video is actually an advert. This can be very misleading to young people who may be influenced into buying or wanting something promoted by somebody they admire. Social media and influencer culture can sometimes lead us to derive a false sense of what everyone else is doing and this can definitely have a negative effect on our mental health and wellbeing.
		<h3>Damage to confidence, body image & mental health</h3>
Most of the social media applications have a large selection of filter and lenses. Although these filters are most of the times have been created to promote entertainment and humor, there are some “beautify” filters. The use of these filters can set unrealistic expectations and create feelings of inadequacy. Judging themselves against other users on the app might threaten their confidence or self-worth. It is important for the parents to encourage their children to ”reward” with more “likes” their friends who share more realistic and natural photos.
		<h3>In-app payments</h3>
Many social media applications allow payments for products or add-on features directly through the app. You should be aware that anyone who declares that is under 18 years old cannot use this feature.
		<h3>Exposing location</h3>
The social media application your children use, most likely it exposes their location. This occurs either by sharing the exact location in real-time of your children, or even with the help of your children whenever they add the public locations they are each time they share a photo or an event with their friends. On the other hand, a photo that is uploaded to an application can give more information to third parties than the user is intended to. A photo which includes landmarks in the area, their school uniform, street name, house and even tagging in the location of the photo uploaded an application can expose the child’s location, making it easy to locate them. If their account is not set to private, anyone can access their account and see their location.
		<h3>Be aware of oversharing</h3>
Social media platforms are public platform and anything that’s shared on them can be viewed by anyone. It’s important your children understand that people they do not know could comment on what they share. You should remind your children not to share anything they would not be happy for everyone to see.
		<h3>Profiles aren’t clear</h3>
On most social media applications it’s easy to remain quite anonymous even by creating fake profiles. This means it’s difficult for your children to be clear about whom they’re interacting with. This increases the potential for cyber-bullying or grooming.
		<h3>It’s easy to post “fake news”</h3>
It’s easy for anyone to create and share information social media applications, whether it’s true or not. Sometimes, this is done as a joke. Other times, it’s done to be malicious or support an ideological or political agenda. It’s important to understand that your child could be exposed to this misinformation and take steps to encourage them to question whatever they read.

      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">TOP TIPS FOR PARENTS</h2>
      <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>How to limit the risks</i></p><br>
	  <p class="w3-justify">
		  <h3>Protection of privacy and personal information</h3>
The biggest concern of a parent, whose child uses social media, is the protection of their privacy and their personal information. In the digital world we live in, we, parents should do only one thing. Talk with our children openly, while still being at an early age, and explain to them what privacy and personal data are.<br>

In plain language, privacy is the ability of a person to seclude any personal information about him or her and use this data only whenever and wherever decides to do so.<br>

Personal information or personal data is any information or different pieces of information that relate to an identified or identifiable individual.<br>

Some important steps that you as a parent can follow in order to protect the privacy and the personal data of your child are the following:<br>

		<h3>Train your child on what is personal data</h3>
Your children may unknowingly give away information on their profile or in their live streams. This information may be about their lives, your lives or your family’s life in general. Explain to them that is really important not to disclose to anyone (even to their friends) during a livestream, comment, direct message or any other tool for communication on the platform, any information that contains one or more of the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>their or any member of their family’s name and surname</li>
<li>their home, email and IP address</li>
<li>their ID and passport number</li>
<li>their location data</li>
<li>their cookie IDs</li></ul>

but also
<ul>
<li>their physical and mental health status</li>
<li>their racial or ethnic origin</li>
<li>their political opinions</li>
<li>their religious or philosophical beliefs</li>
<li>their sexual life or sexual orientation</li></ul>

		<h3>Teach your child that keeping something private should be their choice</h3>
Social media love to inform people where other people or what they are doing, and to encourage them to communicate. But this “innocent” information can be valuable for some threatening people. It is matter of great importance, you and your children always check the following in the settings of the social media application they are using or they are going to use:
<ul>
<li>Create and use private accounts, so the media that your children upload, should be visible only to people that they have approved.</li>
<li>Hide their accounts from all internal and external search engines.</li>
<li>Turn off the auto-play function on all media and set so only approved friends can message the child.</li>
<li>Use strong passwords and the two-factor authentication.</li>
<li>Restrict direct messages, by not accepting messages from somebody they do not know; they can go one step further, by “blocking” this person, so they will not be able to message your children again.</li>
<li>Remove any payment method or at least add a PIN, which needs to be entered before making a payment; this will prevent any unauthorized purchases.</li>
<li>Turn off any “quick add” feature the application has and usually encourages the user to use it; explain to your children that this feature could be the back door through strangers can have access to their profile.</li>
<li>Restrict the access to their media to their friend or create a list with their closest friends, with whom can share their stories and media; it is highly recommended to turn off any feature which automatically shares photos and videos from one application to another and mostly to a Facebook account.</li></ul>

		<h3>“Reporting and blocking” tools are our allies</h3>
All social media applications give the ability to the user to report or block another user or any media. This tools send a report to the social media organization for further investigation. It is of great importance the children to know how and when to use these useful tools:
<ul>
<li>Discuss with your children what is a “reporting and blocking” tool; find together or show them how they can report and block specific content that is potentially harmful, inappropriate, offensive or upsetting.</li>
<li>Advice your children never to send any negative messages to strangers, even if they are getting provoked to do so; encourage them to screenshot this messages and you can use them in order to report this incident to the social media organization; after that advise them to delete the message.</li>
<li>Encourage your children to seek alternative opinions and news stories and not rely on a single source for information, especially if it appears to be unsupported; “fake news” about events or people can also be reported.</li></ul>
