		<h3 class="w3-wide w3-center">WHAT IS IT?</h3>
		<p class="w3-justify">Snapchat is a photo sharing app for mobile phones and tablets. The app allows users to share images, videos and chat with friends through voice call or text message. Users can share images and videos directly to specific friends, or through a “story” shared with their entire friend list, which documents the previous 24 hours. </p>

				<h3>Addictive snapstreaks</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-eye-slash fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">“Snap Streaks” are gained when snaps have been sent back and forth consecutively between friends. The longer that snaps are sent between users, the longer the streak becomes. Furthermore, Snapchat rewards users who have achieved high Snap Streaks, by gifting emojis, adding incentives for users to keep the streaks. Children invest time into making their streaks as long as possible, which can put an incredible amount of pressure on both themselves and their friendships.</p>

				<h3>Sexting</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-search fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">While Snapchat’s gimmick is that all photos, videos and text disappear eventually, users still have the capability to screenshot or record anything which has been sent to them. Users may sometimes forget that screenshotting is possible and send a compromising image or message to somebody who they think they trust. Due to ‘Snaps’ disappearing, (users can even send a one-second photo or video), Snapchat has become the chosen platform for children and young people to send sexually explicit images or ‘selfies.’ Once a photo/video has been screenshotted, or recorded using another device or software, this can lead to further dangers, such as blackmail and cyberbullying.</p>

				<h3>Extras to make you stay</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-tags fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">Aside from taking photos and videos, Snapchat has other elements to keep users coming back for more. ‘Snap Games’ is a feature within the app where users can play minigames with others on their friends list. The games function is easily accessed by tapping on the rocket button during a conversation. Another feature on the app is ‘Snap Originals’, which allows users to watch content created by Snapchat, celebrities and other accounts, including a mixture of comedy shows, drama, news and more. These features are designed to encourage users to stay on the app, which may be quite addictive.</p>

				<h3>The risks of sexting</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-filter fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">Talk to your children about the consequences of sexting and make sure that they’re aware of the risks. Ensure your children know that ‘Snaps’ can be screenshotted. Teach them that if they post anything potentially embarrassing or harmful (either of themselves or someone else it can have severe consequences as the message, image or video can be shared further.</p>

  			<div class="w3-col s6 w3-pale-yellow w3-center w3-mobile w3-border">
				<h3>Use “ghost mode”</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-shield fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">We highly recommend enabling ‘Ghost Mode’ on the app so that your child’s location will no longer be visible to anyone on the ‘Snap Map.’ To enable this, go onto the Snap Map and tap the cog in the top-right corner. Here, change the setting to ‘Ghost Mode.’</p>
