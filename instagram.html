		<h3 class="w3-wide w3-center">WHAT IS IT?</h3>
		<p class="w3-justify">Instagram is a social networking app. The app is a kind of an online gallery allowing users to upload images and videos to their feed. Images and videos can be transformed with an array of filters to edit the shot before sharing. To make posts easier to find, users can include searchable hashtags and captions to their uploads. </p>

				<h3>Live streaming to strangers</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-eye-slash fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">Live streaming on Instagram allows users to connect with friends and followers in real-time and comment on videos during broadcast, but this feature can be turned off. If your child's account is private, only their approved followers can see their story. Its important to note they may have accepted a friend request from someone they don’t know, which means they could be live streaming to strangers. Children also risk sharing content they later regret, which could be re-shared online for years to come. Public accounts allow anybody to view, so we suggest your child blocks followers they don't know.</p>

				<h3>Hijacked hashtags</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-search fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">Hashtags are an extremely prominent tool in Instagram and with that comes dangers for your child. One person may use a seemingly innocent hashtag with one particular thing in mind, and before you know it hundreds of people could be using the same hashtag for something inappropriate or dangerous that your child certainly shouldn’t be exposed to.</p>

				<h3>IGTV</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-tags fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">Instagram TV (IGTV) works similarly to YouTube. Users can watch videos from favorite accounts on the platform or create their own channel and post their own videos. It’s important to note anyone can create an Instagram TV channel and doesn't have to be friends with a person to follow an account and watch their videos. As the feature may encourage spending more time using the app, it's important to set time limits to avoid children's sleep or education being disturbed.</p>

				<h3>Look out for ads</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-filter fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">Many celebrities using Instagram are posting adverts and not declare that they get paid for. Influencers must clearly state that they have been paid for their posts, for example using a hashtag like #ad or #sponsored. Teach your child to look out for the signs of a paid post/advert and discuss with them that not everything they see from celebrities is their personal choice and opinion.</p>

				<h3>“Anti-bullying” filter</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-shield fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">Instagram has an ‘anti-bullying’ filter, which hides comments relating to a person’s appearance or character, as well as threats to a person’s wellbeing or health. The filter will also alert Instagram to repeated problems so they can take action against the user if necessary. This is an automatic filter, but it can be turned off. Make sure it is turned on in the app’s settings.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="w3-col s4 w3-deep-orange w3-center w3-mobile w3-border">
				<h3>Scrolling</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-shield fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">Instagram added a “You've completely caught up” message in late 2018. This message breaks up the feed and notifies you when you are up to date and there are no more new posts from followers. This features is enabled automatically, but have the conversation with your child about how much time they are spending on the app and set healthy time limits.</p>
