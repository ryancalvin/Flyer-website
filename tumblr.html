		<h3 class="w3-wide w3-center">WHAT IS IT?</h3>
		<p class="w3-justify">Tumblr is a social media platform and microblogging site. The platform is designed to share
different types of content, such as videos, photos or short articles. People can react to each
other’s content, share items they like, and even interact through the platform with direct
messages.</p>

				<h3>Watch out for adult content</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-eye-slash fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">You can post almost anything on Tumblr, so it’s important you’re aware of what your child is exposed to. In fact, it was briefly removed from the Apple store when it was found users were sharing illegal content involving the sexual abuse of children. There has since been a ban on being able to share “adult” material, but some material still slips through the net.</p>

				<h3>A broad search function</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-search fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">The broad search tool on Tumblr makes it very easy for anyone to find almost any kind of content. It has even been found there to be content about eating disorders and self-harm that could be damaging to a young person’s mental health. There is no easy way to stop this broad search function, so it pays to educate your child on the risk of searching for such topics.</p>

  			<div class="w3-col s4 w3-blue-grey w3-center w3-mobile w3-border">
				<h3>Misleading tags/acronym</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-tags fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">The “tagging” function on Tumblr allows users to label relevant content and makes searching more effective. However, such tags often employ words with a dual meaning or strange acronyms that can lead to inappropriate content being associated with something innocent.</p>

				<h3>Filter content</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-filter fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">It’s not possible to filter out all mentions of a potential harmful phrase, but you can filter out certain posts that are tagged with the phrase. You can do this in the account settings.</p>
			</div>
  			<div class="w3-col s4 w3-light-blue w3-center w3-mobile w3-border">
				<h3>Activate safe mode</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-shield fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">You can turn on ‘Safe Mode’, which will hide sensitive content, however it’s equally important to monitor your child. If you see their behavior changing, calmly offer support and ask them if something is bothering them.</p>
			</div>
  			<div class="w3-col s4 w3-blue-grey w3-center w3-mobile w3-border">
				<h3>Respect original content</h3>
				<i class="fa fa-copyright fa-3x w3-padding-24"></i>
				<p class="w3-justify w3-margin">It’s easy to repost any content on Tumblr so it appears as your own. To avoid your child falling foul of any copyright or trademark infringements, make sure they understand the importance of citing the original author of anything they wish to share.</p>
